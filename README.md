# DRA_in_D2D
A Distributed Heuristic Approach to Allocate Resources in D2D Networks
- node_generator_v01.cpp: Generating D2D pairs where the distance between each D2D sender and D2D receiver is less than a predefined value
- node_generator_v02.cpp: Generating D2D pairs where the distance between each D2D sender and D2D receiver is equal to a predefined value
- node_generator_v03.cpp: Generating D2D pairs where the distance between each D2D sender and D2D receiver is set to be random
- shared_resource_allocation.cpp: Assigning frequency channels using the second-price auction and controlling transmit powers using the non-cooprating game
- script_ng.sh: Generating different D2D networks
- script_ra.sh: Allocating resources for different D2D networks
